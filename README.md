# AnimeFiltering
This project consists of collaborative and Content based filtering for anime recommendations.

The order of execution of the three notebooks is: DataProcessing.ipynb, EDA.ipynb, CollaborativeFiltering.ipynb.

The repository also contains some .csv files relating to the project (some were too large).

The project tests three different types of recommendation: user-based filtering, item-based filtering, and content-based filtering, with the goal being to minimize RMSE error for the test data.
